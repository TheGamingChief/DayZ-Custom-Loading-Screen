# DayZ Custom Loading Screen

## Known Issues
This loading screen template does not work on ultrawide monitors currently.

This template does not work on with DayZ Expansion, instead take a look at [this](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BModding%5D-Adding-custom-loading-screen).

## Video Tutorial
A video tutorial showing the full process of creating your own loading screen with this template can be found [here](https://youtu.be/7FdC9JfuliI).

## Text Tutorial
The text tutorial is a WIP, this will be updated with detailed text directions along with screenshots in the near future.

 - Download this files contained in this repo. DO NOT rename the "Loadingscreen" folder unless you change all references in the mod files.
 - Create a loadingscreen.edds (recommended image size is 2560x1440) and replace the existing one in the "Loadingscreen" folder. This can be done with DayZ Workbench (this is included in DayZ tools).
 - Use Addon Builder to build the addon.
 - Use DS Utils to sign your new addon.
 - Use Publisher to publish your addon to the Steam Workshop.
 - Add your addon to your server.
 - Join your server and verify everything is working!
